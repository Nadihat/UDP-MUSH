# UDP MUSH
There's little research on this. It's an UDP MUSH, better described as `MU*`, at least for now. It's still rather bare.

On real usage, it has proven to be low-latency. I enjoy there's no "broken pipe" as in default SSH installations, and that I can leave the client executing while the server is updated.

No reliability issues seen yet in testing. No disordered messages, jumbled letters and so forth.

Built with Gemini CLI.
